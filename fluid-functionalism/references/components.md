# Fluid Functionalism — component catalog

Install with `npx shadcn@latest add @fluid/<registry name>` (add `--overwrite`
when stock shadcn files exist). A second name in the Registry column means the
component has a Base UI flavor — use it when the project depends on
`@base-ui/react`. Every row links to its doc page or the closest parent page,
with live examples, props, and a Copy prompt button. Its Craft column points
to the exact section in [craft.md](craft.md) to read before composing;
standalone parts without their own page point to the parent component whose
behavior they extend.

## Systems

Shared infrastructure — each installs as code, the same way. Components pull
these in automatically as dependencies; install one directly when custom code
needs it.

| System | Registry name | What it does | Craft |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Fluid Hover](https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/docs/fluid-hover) | `use-fluid-hover` | One hook and one highlight per list. The highlight glides to the item nearest your cursor and never blinks off between rows | [Fluid Hover](craft.md#fluid-hover) |
| [Motion](https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/docs/motion) | `springs` | 3 spring speeds — fast, moderate, slow — each with an exit one tier quicker than its entrance | [Motion](craft.md#motion) |
| [Scrollbars](https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/docs/scrollbars) | `scroll-area` · `base/scroll-area` | A scrollbar that stays out of the way but never disappears, with native scroll on touch | [Scrollbars](craft.md#scrollbars) |
| [Sizes](https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/docs/sizes) | `size-context` | 2 sizes, a 36px default and a 28px compact, shared by buttons, inputs, selects, tabs, and rows | [Sizes](craft.md#sizes) |
| [Surfaces](https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/docs/surfaces) | `elevated` | 8 elevation levels so popovers, dropdowns, and dialogs stay visible at any depth, in light and dark | [Surfaces](craft.md#surfaces) |
| [Typography](https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/docs/typography) | `typography` (brings `size-context`) | 6 type roles, each a size and a line height at both sizes, plus `.typeset`, a prose sheet for rendered markdown | [Typography](craft.md#typography) |

Other installable libs and hooks (usually arrive as dependencies):
`font-weight` (variable weight tokens for the ghost-span pattern),
`icon-context` (named icon slots, Lucide defaults, `IconProvider` override),
`shape-context` (pill or rounded), `surface-context` / `surface-classes` /
`tokens` (elevation plumbing and `bg-hover`/`bg-active` state tokens),
`popup` (shared popup chrome), `use-touch-primary`, `use-keyboard-nav-gate`,
`use-merge-split` (the merged selected-background animation).

## Blocks

Compositions that install as one item, with every component they use.

| Block | Registry name | What it is | Craft |
|---|---|---|---|
| [App Sidebar](https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/docs/sidebar) | `sidebar-app` · `base/sidebar-app` | A complete app shell: workspace header, search field, collapsible sections with badges, user footer, and an inset topbar | [App Sidebar](craft.md#sidebar-app) |
| [Settings Dialog](https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/docs/dialog) | `dialog-sidebar` · `base/dialog-sidebar` | The xl Dialog as a canvas, a Sidebar of sections down its left edge, and a scrolling panel of controls | [Settings Dialog](craft.md#dialog-sidebar) |
| [Queued message stack](https://www.fluidfunctionalism.com/docs/input-message) | `queued-stack` · `base/queued-stack` | Sonner-style stack of queued composer messages: fan out on hover, drag to reorder, morph into the sent message | [Queued stack](craft.md#queued-stack) |

Smaller sidebar blocks also install individually, and each has a Base UI
flavor too: `sidebar-workspace-header` · `base/sidebar-workspace-header`,
`sidebar-user-footer` · `base/sidebar-user-footer`, `sidebar-search-field` ·
`base/sidebar-search-field`, `sidebar-inset-topbar` ·
`base/sidebar-inset-topbar`. They are parts of the complete shell, so use the
[App Sidebar craft](craft.md#sidebar-app) plus the installed source for the
part itself.

## Choosing quickly

- App shell / navigation → `sidebar-app` block (or `sidebar` to compose your own)
- Settings surface → `dialog-sidebar` block
- Chat / AI interface → `input-message` + `chat-message` + `thinking-steps` +
  `thinking-indicator` (+ `queued-stack`, `ask-user-questions`), and
  `typography` for the markdown in replies (`.typeset`)
- Docs, changelogs, any rendered markdown → `typography` (`.typeset`)
- Action palette → `command-menu` (dialog shell on ⌘K included)
- Forms → `input-group`, `select`, `combobox`, `checkbox-group`,
  `radio-group`, `switch`, `slider`, `color-picker`
- Data display → `table`, `card` (grid layout has 2-D fluid hover), `badge`
- Custom list/menu/grid you're writing yourself → `use-fluid-hover` +
  `springs`, then follow
  [custom-motion.md](custom-motion.md)
- Text in custom UI → `typeClass(role, variant)` from `size-context` (the
  [Typography craft](craft.md#typography) says which role), never raw px
